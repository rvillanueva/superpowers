      <h1>What's your useless superpower?</h1>
      You know how on Harry Potter's 11th birthday he gets a letter from Hogwarts or something? Well, this is sort of like that, except you get superpowers, and instead of your birthday, it's on Ryan's.<br><br>
      If you wished Ryan a happy birthday, you can click below to see your probably inconvenient superpower. Or even if you didn't. In which case, boo you.
